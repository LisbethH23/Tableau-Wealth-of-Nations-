Finding 1: The relationship in GDP, life expectancy and users of smartphones.
Finding 2: The Wealth of nations per capita which is was Monaco accorsingly my data provided.

Finding 3: The 20 top countries with more life expectancy in the world, being an average of 80 years in advance.

Conclusion: Tableau is great visualization programme, I could creat various visualisations in order to provide best anaylisis in the Wealth of nations data.
Visual analysis: After the creation of the differents visuals I found that Japan was the most country in the world with more life expectancy, China was the
country witht the most Smarthphones users, this is a direct relationship as China has more population in comparison with the rest of the countries.
Troubleshooting: I have some irregular map visual but I found the correct parameters by doing some research online, I fixed it and have as a result a map with shows all the countries with the more life expectancy.

Tools: Tableau and Excel
